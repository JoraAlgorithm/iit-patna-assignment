1 Problem Statement
In the first semester at IIT Patna, let us assume the students enrolled for the three subjects, EE101, CS102, and CH103. Note that the subject code is a total of five characters, two uppercase followed by three digits.
Write a C program which takes as inputs the three-digit (integer) associated with subject codes and scores out of 100. Further, print the given inputs in the given format. [10 Marks] Your Score in EE101 is 85
Your Score in CS102 is 95
Your Score in CH103 is 90
Further, compute the average and grade of the students (only using if control
statements, syntax given) as per the given grading policy. if average ≥ 85 then the Grade is Ex
if average < 85, ≥ 70 then the Grade is A
if average < 70, ≥ 55 then the Grade is B
if average < 55, then the Grade is F
Finally, print the average and grade in the given format. Your average is 90, and the Grade is Ex.
